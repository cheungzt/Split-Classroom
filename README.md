# Game Introduction: Split Classroom

Welcome to "Split Classroom" â€” a fun little game designed based on our experiences at PolyU, addressing emotional management and academic challenges through an interactive narrative. In this game, you play as a student facing various classes, teachers, and unexpected events. With each round of choices, your emotional value (P-value) will fluctuate with the development of events. The goal is to keep your P-value below 100 and successfully manage your emotions, overcoming inner anxiety and unease.

## Game Rules:

1. Emotional Value (P-value): Your P-value represents your current emotional state. The initial value is 50, with a range of 0-100. The higher the P-value, the closer you are to an emotional breakdown. If the P-value reaches 100, your emotions are out of control, and the game ends.

2. Weekly Class Schedule: Each day brings different classes and unexpected events. You will influence the P-value by choosing different actions. Each teacher's personality, class content, and unexpected events will affect your choices and emotions.

3. Choices and Consequences: Each time you face a choice, it will lead to fluctuations in the P-value. Your task is to manage your emotions well, keep the P-value within a controllable range, and make the most appropriate choices based on the teachers' personalities.

4. Timing Mechanism: At the start of each day, time will automatically pass, and the P-value will increase with the passage of time. Every 5 minutes, the P-value increases by 5 points. Once you make a choice, the mechanism of P-value increase due to the passage of time will temporarily stop until you enter the next round of choices.

## Gameplay:

1. Daily Scenarios: At the start of each day, you will see a brief inner monologue or situation description, which will help you understand your current emotional state and the challenges you are about to face.

2. Class Interactions: You will face different classes and classroom situations. In each class, the teacher's feedback and your choices will affect your P-value. Make the most appropriate decisions based on the teacher's personality.

3. Unexpected Events: In addition to classes, you will encounter some unexpected events (such as coffee machine breakdowns, mentor conversations, etc.), which will also affect your emotions.

4. Choices and Feedback: Each choice will lead to fluctuations in the P-value. Depending on your choices, you will receive different feedback. Make decisions that best help you manage your emotions based on the teacher's personality and classroom situation.

5. P-value Management: The goal of the game is to keep the P-value below 100 through reasonable choices. If your P-value reaches 100, the game ends. You need to pay attention to your emotions at all times to avoid losing control.
